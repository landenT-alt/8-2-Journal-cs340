How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I think that the best way to create programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to make sure that the program is modular and easily transferred. The work that I have done on project two has been easily interchangable with the other projects and milestones. It makes it very easy to update and delete things as well as make any changes. Working like this saves time.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

When approaching a problem as a computer scientist you need to use critical thinking. Each part of the problem is broken down an analyzed to find a solution. My approach to the dashboard Grazioso Salvar requested was more focused on the small things I knew I had to accomplish in the code in order to create the dashboard. I will use techniques such as test cases and pass and fail requriements to help me with client request in the future. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists identify challenges and come up with solutions. They do this by breaking down the challenge and testing how there awsner reacts and then editing there awnser. My work for this type of project helps companies do there job better because it allows them to have a easier time locating and identifying animals that fit there needs.
